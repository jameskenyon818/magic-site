              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What is close-up magic?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Close-up magic is performed right in front of your guests, often using everyday objects like cards, coins, or borrowed items. It creates a personal and interactive experience where the magic happens literally in the palm of your hand, leaving guests amazed and engaged. As your Miami magician, I specialize in making these moments unforgettable.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How long does a close-up magic performance last?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                I typically perform for 2â€“3 hours, moving seamlessly among your guests or tables. This ensures that everyone enjoys the magic while maintaining the natural flow of the event. For events with more than 300 guests, I may need additional time to ensure everyone has the opportunity to experience the magic.

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                I can comfortably entertain groups ranging from 10 to 300 guests. For larger events (over 300), I may recommend extending my time at your event to ensure every guest experiences the magic firsthand. I move naturally between tables or clusters of people, making sure the magic reaches everyone.
